    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>I chose a theme about how I plan to pass SDI since I failed to do so the first time I faced the chellenge. When I started project 1, the subject of how to pass this class was on my mind, and that is why it ended up as my theme.</p>
<p>I decided to stick with the same theme for this project for a number of reasons. The most important reason was that I could easily set up variable arrays for which to do the assignment with.</p>
